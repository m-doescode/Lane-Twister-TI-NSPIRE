# Lane-Twister-TI-NSPIRE
Lane Twister is a quick game I made for the TI-Nspire CX Cas in lua.
Don't expect much. If anything, expect sloppy coding

# Hey, I wanna actually play the game, how do I play?

If you haven't already, go to [How to download][How to download] to install it into your calculator

> Note: This is for TI-Nspire CX Cas only. I haven't tested for CX II or any others.

Use up/down arrows to navigate or optionally, if you want to keep your fingers on the buttons, you can also use the 8 and 2 keys.

# Commands

(What's a real game without console commands?)

`Ctrl + trig` v or `?` will bring up the console
WARNING: If you open the console, your highscore will no longer be saved. To reverse these changes, type `!cheatsoff`

You can directly type lua functions to execute certain parts of the code in the game

### List of console commands:

* `!invc [new state]` - Toggles invincibilty, or turns it on or off
* `!score <score>` - Sets your new score
* `!level/lvl` - Sets your level/speed
* `!cheatsoff` - Reverts changes from since you opened the console so you can save your highscore again without restarting app
And a more destructive command...
* `!reset` - Resets your highscore and starts from the beginning, if you find yourself bored, of course.

### List of functions you can poke and prod to:

* `updateScore(int score)` - Updates score
```diff
+ TODO: finish list.
```
